# ElectroJo's Sandra Fork
Sandra is a "powerful multi-purpose Discord bot" developed by **[averen](https://github.com/averen)** and **[legolog3](https://github.com/legolog3)** with product design by **Blair** and artwork by **[CandyCanvas](https://twitter.com/candycanvasart)**

Add the official Sandra to your own server by clicking [here](https://sandrabot.com/invite).

This repository is not the official codebase for Sandra, these are edits that I've made that may (unlikely) or may not (likely) be implemented into the Sandra codebase. 

If you open this fork in IntelliJ IDEA and set the Gradle JVM to adopt-openj9-13 and Kotlin to JVM 1.6 it should work. Oh and you need a Redis server. However, I do not provide any additional support to this project at all. The error messages should be enough to help you figure out what the issue is.
